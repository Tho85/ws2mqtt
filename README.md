# ws2mqtt - WiSafe2 to MQTT gateway

ws2mqtt is an inofficial gateway to connect WiSafe2 smoke, heat and CO detectors to your smart home.

The gateway consists of an ESP32 module that handles Wifi and MQTT communication and integrates with Home Assistant through MQTT auto discovery. It is connected to an Arduino that acts as an SPI/UART converter. The Arduino talks to an official WiSafe2 module that is connected to your smoke detector network.

## Additional Hardware required

- [ESP32-DevKitC V4](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/hw-reference/esp32/get-started-devkitc.html)
- [Arduino Pro Mini](https://www.arduino.cc/en/pmwiki.php?n=Main/ArduinoBoardProMini), or chinese clone
- [WiSafe2 module](https://www.directtradesupplies.co.uk/product.php/199997/fireangel-wisafe2-module--wireless-alarm-pairing--all-wisafe2--mains---battery-only--alarms-can-be-paired---white-)
- A 868 MHz antenna, e.g. stripped from a defective detector. Alternatively, an 8.8 cm long wire
- Custom PCB (see `PCB` folder). Alternatively, lots of breadboard wires (see [schematic](PCB/schematic.pdf))

## Setup

- Setup Arduino
  - Mount Arduino to PCB
  - Flash Arduino firmware (see `Firmware-Atmega` folder) via programmer
- Setup ESP32
  - Mount ESP32 to PCB
  - Configure your secrets in `Firmware-ESP/include/credentials.h` (see example)
  - Flash ESP32 firmware (see `Firmware-ESP` folder) via USB
- Power board via ESP32 USB connector
- Setup WiSafe2 module
  - Mount WiSafe2 module to PCB
  - Join WiSafe2 network
    - Push button on module for 5 seconds
    - Module LED should light up
    - Within 5 seconds, push test button on a different detector
    - Module LED should blink multiple times as a confirmation
- Mount ESP32, Arduino and WiSafe2 module on PCB
- Configure Home Assistant
  - The gateway and all detectors should be visible in the "Devices" tab
  - Create an automation that listens for the `alarm` event emitted by the gateway, see below

## Tips & troubleshooting

* The recommended way to react to smoke detection and test events in Home Assistant is to listen to the `alarm` event emitted by the `ws2mqtt Bridge` device. This event is fired when any of the connected detectors detects smoke, or when any of the detectors' test buttons is pressed. This way you can test your emergency scenes and automations by pressing a detector's test button.

* _The "smoke detected" sensor shows an unknown state_

  This is actually a deficiency of the WiSafe2 protocol. As far as I know, there is no way to query a device for the current smoke / heat detector state. Additionally, a "smoke detected" message is only sent once to other detectors, and not repeated later. So if you start the gateway while a "smoke detected" event is ongoing, there is no way for the gateway to know about that event. I decided to err on the side of caution and show the state of devices as "unknown".

* _The "battery" sensor, "docked" sensor etc. show an unknown state_

  To conserve battery power, the gateway does not actively query the state of these diagnostic sensors. The sensor state is only updated on change. The easiest way to force an update is to remove a detector from its base, wait a bit, and re-mount the device. This should update not only the "docked" sensor, but also the battery ones.

* What is the programming language you used, and why is it not perfect C?

  C is not my mother tongue, so it's nearly certain that there are race conditions, buffer overflows or bad C programming practices in the code. Feel free to file an issue to point things out, or even better file a pull request.
